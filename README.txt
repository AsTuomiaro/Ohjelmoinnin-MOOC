This directory contains all the projects I did for the MOOC courses Ohjelmoinnin
perusteet and OhjeÄºmoinnin jatkokurssi at the Department of Computer Science at 
the University of Helsinki Autumn 2018. All the course material is under the
Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license, and can be used freely. My work, however, is
not. You are free to read the source code and give feedback, but please don't 
steal my code. Otherwise I promise you the universe will take action on my behalf.

Also, if I have added other projects or stuff here, please have a look.
